JAGs code used by Cruz et al. (in review) 'Management of a recovering apex predator: from individual nest protection to 
population growth of bald eagles Haliaeetus leucocephalus' Submitted to Journal of Applied Ecology.

The code describes an Integrated Population Model (IPM) evaluating the recovery of bald eagles in Voyageurs National Park 
during 1973-2016. The IPM integrates nest occupancy and reproductive output data to estimate nest-level probabilities of occupancy, 
nest success, and high productivity (producing â‰¥ 2 fledglings), as well as population-level estimates of abundance, growth, 
mean brood size, nest success rate, and productivity rate.
